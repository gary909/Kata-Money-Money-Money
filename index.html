        Mr. Scrooge has a sum of money 'P' that he wants to invest. Before he does, he wants to know how many years<br>
         'Y' this sum 'P' has to be kept in the bank in order for it to amount to a desired sum of money 'D'.<br>
         <br>
        The sum is kept for 'Y' years in the bank where interest 'I' is paid yearly. After paying taxes 'T' for the<br>
         year the new sum is re-invested.<br>
         <br>
        Note to Tax: not the invested principal is taxed, but only the year's accrued interest<br>
        <br>
        Example:<br>
        <br>
        Let P be the Principal = 1000.00      <br>
        Let I be the Interest Rate = 0.05     <br> 
        Let T be the Tax Rate = 0.18      <br>
        Let D be the Desired Sum = 1100.00<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        After 1st Year --><br>
        P = 1041.00<br>
        After 2nd Year --><br>
        P = 1083.86<br>
        After 3rd Year --><br>
        P = 1128.30<br>
        Thus Mr. Scrooge has to wait for 3 years for the initial principal to amount to the desired sum.<br>
        <br>
        Your task is to complete the method provided and return the number of years 'Y' as a whole in order for <br>
        Mr. Scrooge to get the desired sum.<br>
        <br>
        Assumption: Assume that Desired Principal 'D' is always greater than the initial principal. However it <br>
        is best to take into consideration that if Desired Principal 'D' is equal to Principal 'P' this should <br>
        return 0 Years.<br>
